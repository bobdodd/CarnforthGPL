Here are the headings on the page, in reading order, along with why I think they are headings:

1. **Popular Services**: This is a heading because it is in a larger font size and bolded, and it is followed by a list of services provided by the Niagara Regional Police Service.
2. **Spotlight**: This is a heading because it is in a larger font size and bolded, and it is followed by a section that highlights a specific aspect of the police service.
3. **Latest News**: This is a heading because it is in a larger font size and bolded, and it is followed by a list of recent news articles.

5. **Serving and Protecting the Regional Municipality of Niagara**: This is a heading because it is in a larger font size and bolded, and it is followed by a section that describes the police service's role in serving and protecting the region.
